SherlockPHP.org Documentation
=========

This repository holds the code that generates the [SherlockPHP.org] website. If you are interested in helping write documentation or fix errors...simply fork this repo, make some changes and submit a pull request.  Once merged, a git hook will push the changes live to the website.

This site uses [Phrozn], a static website generator (similar to Jekyll). It can use a variety of input formats, but much of the site is done in [Twig] templating language.  Twig provides a good mix of templating functionality and raw HTML - please use Twig unless you have a good reason to use something else.
