                <p  class='section-paragraph'>Want to get involved with Sherlock?  Awesome! The documentation site can always use some love. If you see some parts of the docs that are unclear, too brief or outright missing, we would love some help fixing them up! A project is only as good as its documentation, and unfortunately, documentation for Sherlock is very sparse.</p>
                <p class='section-paragraph'>This entire documentation site is <a href="https://github.com/polyfractal/sherlockphp.org">hosted on Github</a>, so just fork a copy, make some changes and submit a Pull Request.  The site uses <a href="http://www.phrozn.info/en/">Phrozn</a>, a static HTML generator that is similar to Jekyll.  Most of the site is written in Twig, which offers a nice mix of templating features and raw HTML.</p>
                <p class='section-paragraph'>Want to work on code? Head over to <a href="https://github.com/polyfractal/sherlock">Github and make a fork of the repository</a>, then start hacking away.  Perhaps help fix some of the <a href="https://github.com/polyfractal/sherlock/issues/">outstanding issues</a>, or implement a new feature that you wish Sherlock supported?  You'll be my best friend if you help fill out the testbed!</p>

                <p  class='section-paragraph'>Sherlock doesn't have a formal coding standard (yet?), so try to maintain the style that the rest of the code has.  Some tips:</p>
                <ul  class='section-paragraph'>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Use Docblocs on all your functions, variables and any particularly difficult sections of code.  Eventually, we will generate a PHPDoc site from the annotations</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Try to follow PSR-0/1/2 in your code.  PSR-0 is required for autoloading, and 1/2 are useful for consistent formatting.  I routinely run php-cs-fixer over the codebase to clean things up.</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Write tests for new features!  Admittedly, the current testbed is very lacking (its on the todo list).  If you add new features, I'll love you forever if you include a nice test suite.</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px">Sherlock should present a consistent, easy, fluid interface to developers.  I will accept ugly internal code if it makes for a beautiful exterior API.  That said, let's try and keep Sherlock sparkly and clean inside too :)</li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px"><a href="http://phpmd.org/">PHP Mess Detector</a> and <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/redirected">PHP Code Sniffer</a> are great tools.  I routinely take their advice regarding complexity.</li>
